# Bankruptcy-Prediction---Machine-Learning
Predict bankruptcy in Polish companies using machine learning algorithms
Here, we have the data about the polish companies along with their econometric indicators. The
data was collected from Emerging Markets Information Service which is a database containing
information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in
the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013.
Basing on the collected data five classification cases were distinguished. Each of the classification
corresponds to one forecasting period. Hence, we have 5 sets of records which we will be
combining into a single file. We will be modelling this data to predict the companies that are most
likely to get bankrupt.
The use case of this project is concerned about the investors who are planning on investing in
the polish companies. Our assumption is that, the investors wants to be so sure about the
financial stability of a company before investing on them. In other words, the investors must be
able to identify and be cautious about the companies that are at the verge of bankruptcy. 

## Data Source 
• It has 64 predictor variables which are all numerical.
• It has a binary target variable which indicates the bankruptcy.
• There are 43405 records for a total fo 5 years.
• The target variable is imbalanced. The success class 1 accounts for only 4.82 % of the
entire dataset
